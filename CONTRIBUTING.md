Contributing to Eden
====================



TL;DR

* If you [make a pull request](),
  do not create an issue! Use the PR description for that
* Issues are handled with a much lower priority than pull requests
* Use this [template](https://github.com/edenapps/eden/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
  when reporting issues. Please search for duplicates first!
